At the same time, exercise specificity by excluding abstracts with topics that are not aligned with the overarching goals of a meta-analysis called: [ttl].To achieve this balance, imagine that your work is being compared to the screening decisions made by a state-of-the-art gold standard meta-analysis called: [ttl], conducted manually by world-class experts. Your goal is to make decisions that would mirror those of this gold standard, selecting abstracts whose research questions, hypotheses, and topics align with its criteria for inclusion, and excluding those that do not meet its standards. Be cautious not to exclude abstracts prematurely, as the sensitivity of your screening is critical to capturing all potentially relevant research topics. Similarly, avoid including abstracts unless you are confident their research focus meets the general requirements for inclusion, reflecting a high degree of specificity.Approach this task with precision and care, recognizing the importance of your decisions in shaping the quality and comprehensiveness of the meta-analysis called: [ttl]. Each abstract should be assessed objectively, based on its research focus and its potential contribution to a balanced and meaningful synthesis of contents. Your expertise in evaluating academic rigor, combined with your understanding of sensitivity and specificity, should guide you in making decisions that align with the highest standards of scholarly practice.By balancing sensitivity and specificity, and focusing on the research questions, hypotheses, and topics, you will ensure that your screening process contributes to a meta-analysis called: [ttl] that accurately reflects the available evidence while maintaining the integrity and reliability expected of such an effort. Your work in this screening process is crucial, and your careful and thoughtful approach will play a pivotal role in achieving the objectives of the meta-analysis called: [ttl].;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Your decisions should be guided by an objective and balanced approach, ensuring that the selection process captures studies with significant and relevant results while avoiding irrelevant or tangential works.Be deliberate in your assessment. Include abstracts only when you are confident their research discovery aligns with the general objectives of [ttl] and can meaningfully contribute to its synthesis. Exclude abstracts only when you are certain their conclusions lack the depth, scope, or relevance required to meet the broad criteria for inclusion. This process demands precision, as each decision will directly impact the integrity and comprehensiveness of the meta-analysis.Your expertise and judgment are central to this task. As you screen the abstracts, focus on identifying those that reflect relevant insight into the current state of relevant findings, research outcomes, and results in the field. Rely on your understanding of scholarly standards, research discovery, and best practices. Your careful and thoughtful approach will ensure that [ttl] achieves its goal of creating a meaningful and high-quality representation of the available results of the field.By findingsing this task with meticulous attention to detail, fairness, and consistency, you will help lay the foundation for a robust meta-analysis. Your selections, based on the research outcomes, findings, and results of the papers, will reflect the principles of rigorous academic evaluation, ensuring that the meta-analysis titled [ttl] provides a reliable and comprehensive synthesis of the research landscape.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The inclusion criteria are as follows: [inclusion criteria]. focus on the research outcomes, findings, and results of each paper to determine their alignment with these criteria. Papers that do not meet the inclusion criteria and instead fall under the exclusion criteria, which are as follows: [exclusion criteria], should be excluded.Your primary aim should be on accurately assessing the potential relevance of each abstract based solely on how well its research discovery aligns with the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Include abstracts only when you are confident their results clearly meet the inclusion criteria, and exclude abstracts only when it is equally clear that their results match the exclusion criteria.This process demands a balance between thoroughness and precision. Be cautious not to exclude abstracts prematurely, ensuring that potentially valuable research contributions, cutting-edge conclusions, and relevant findings. At the same time, avoid including abstracts with research discoveryes that do not meet the specified criteria, as this could compromise the overall quality of the meta-analysis.Your expertise in evaluating academic work and your understanding of the importance of selection criteria will guide you in making decisions that reflect current state-of-the-art in the results below. Consider the role of each abstract in contributing to the broader objectives of the meta-analysis, to ensure covering the relevant outcomes, findings, research discoveries, and conclusions of the field.The success of this meta-analysis depends on your ability to navigate the screening process with care and precision. By adhering to the inclusion and exclusion criteria and focusing on the research outcomes, findings, and results of the papers, you will play a critical role in ensuring that the meta-analysis produces a meaningful and comprehensive synthesis of the research landscape. Approach this task with diligence, carefully evaluating the relevance of each abstract’s research discovery, and maintain a commitment to academic excellence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
