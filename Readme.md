## Tooldescription

This tool was used for the paper "Paper Name". The Screening Selection Comparison has been the main mode of operation, which is discussed in the paper.
In addition to that we implemented a Comparison-free Screening mode, which is meant to be used for the creation of meta analyses.

The folder Abbildung contains a descriptive image of the UI which will be presented to you upon executing the .exe file or the python code.

Under Pipeline/ExampleFiles you can find a working example for the execution of the pipeline, which is meant to help identifying the needed format of the input files.

The python requirements can be downloaded using the command pip install -r requirements.txt, when you have cloned the repository and made it your working directory. 
Otherwise you can install all the packages in there by hand using pip install <Package>.
