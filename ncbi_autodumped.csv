Registered on 25 April 2023. https://ensaiosclinicos.gov.br/pesquisador.',"b'This is a two-arm, prospectively registered, randomized trial with concealed allocation, double-blind, and intention-to-treat analysis. Forty-four patients with HFrEF will be recruited. The experimental group will undertake 25-30 min aerobic exercise training associated with tDCS, for 4 weeks. The control group will undergo the same aerobic exercise training, but with sham-tDCS. The primary outcome will be functional performance by the 6-min walk test. Secondary outcomes will include cardiopulmonary exercise capacity, inflammatory cytokines, and quality of life. Outcomes will be collected by a researcher blinded to group allocation at baseline (T0) and after 4 weeks of intervention (T1).'",,"b'Although previous studies have investigated the combined effect of tDCS on T3 area and physical performance and have suggested that tDCS could have reduced ratings of perceived exertion by affecting the activity of the insular cortex, and therefore increase exercise tolerance, this study is the first to evaluate the effects of the addition of anodal tDCS to aerobic exercise training for improving physical and functional performance, decreasing the perceived exertion, altering the quantification of inflammatory cytokines, and improving the subclinical values of the cardiopulmonary test in patients with HFrEF, which could result in an important advance in cardiac rehabilitation for patients with chronic HF.'",b''

However, data concerning the association between dapagliflozin and the recurrence of atrial fibrillation (AF), especially in patients following Cox-Maze IV (CMIV), are rare. We aim to explore the effect of dapagliflozin on the recurrence of AF after CMIV with and without T2DM or HF.'",,,"b'The study of dapagliflozin evaluation in AF patients followed by CMIV (DETAIL-CMIV) is a prospective, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial. A total of 240 AF patients who have received the CMIV procedure will be randomized into the dapagliflozin group (10\xe2\x80\x85mg/day, n = 120) and the placebo group (10\xe2\x80\x85mg/day, n = 120) and treated for 3 months.

Rates of POAF were 28.1% after isolated coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), 33.7% after isolated valve repair or replacement, and 47.3% after CABG plus valve repair or replacement. Baseline characteristics associated with an increased risk of POAF identified on multivariable analysis included older age (odds ratio [OR] 1.57; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.42-1.73, per 10\xc2\xa0y), White race or non-Hispanic ethnicity (OR 1.52; CI: 1.11-2.07), history of heart failure (OR 1.55; CI: 1.16-2.08), and history of hypothyroidism (OR 1.42; CI 1.04-1.94). The type of cardiac procedure was associated with an increased risk of POAF with both isolated valve repair or replacement (OR 1.33, CI 1.08-1.64) and combined CABG plus valve repair or replacement (OR 1.64, CI 1.24-2.17) having increased risk of POAF compared to isolated CABG.

Whether there is differential intervention efficacy by race is unknown. Methods and Results In this prespecified analysis, differential intervention effects by race were explored at 3 months for physical function (Short Physical Performance Battery [primary outcome], 6-Minute Walk Distance), cognition, depression, frailty, health-related quality of life (Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire, EuroQoL 5-Dimension-5-Level Questionnaire) and at 6 months for hospitalizations and death.

However, the influence of baseline diastolic blood pressure (DBP) on the effects of intensive blood pressure lowering on cardiovascular outcomes has not been fully elucidated.. We performed a post hoc analysis of the STEP trial. Participants were randomly allocated to intensive (110 to <130 mm\xe2\x80\x89Hg) or standard (130 to <150 mm\xe2\x80\x89Hg) treatment groups. The effects of intensive SBP lowering on the primary composite outcome (stroke, acute coronary syndrome, acute decompensated heart failure, coronary revascularization, atrial fibrillation, and cardiovascular death), major adverse cardiac event (a composite of the individual components of the primary outcome except for stroke), and all-cause mortality were analyzed according to baseline DBP as both a categorical and a continuous variable.. The 8259 participants had a mean age of 66.2\xc2\xb14.8 years, and 46.5% were men. Participants with lower DBP were slightly older and had greater histories of cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia. Within each baseline DBP quartile, the mean achieved DBP was lower in the intensive versus standard group. The effects of intensive SBP lowering were not modified by baseline DBP as a continuous variable or as a categorical variable (quartiles, or <70, 70 to <80, and \xe2\x89\xa580 mm\xe2\x80\x89Hg; all . The beneficial effects of intensive SBP lowering on cardiovascular outcomes were unaffected by baseline DBP. Lower DBP should not be an obstacle to intensive SBP control..
