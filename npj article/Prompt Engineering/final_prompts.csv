Focus on the research questions, hypotheses, and overall topics of each abstract, ensuring that potentially valuable contributions are included with a high degree of sensitivity. At the same time, exercise specificity by excluding abstracts with topics that are not aligned with the overarching goals of a meta-analysis called: [ttl].    To achieve this balance, imagine that your work is being compared to the screening decisions made by a state-of-the-art gold standard meta-analysis called: [ttl], conducted manually by world-class experts. Your goal is to make decisions that would mirror those of this gold standard, selecting abstracts whose research questions, hypotheses, and topics align with its criteria for inclusion, and excluding those that do not meet its standards. Be cautious not to exclude abstracts prematurely, as the sensitivity of your screening is critical to capturing all potentially relevant research topics. Similarly, avoid including abstracts unless you are confident their research focus meets the general requirements for inclusion, reflecting a high degree of specificity.    Approach this task with precision and care, recognizing the importance of your decisions in shaping the quality and comprehensiveness of the meta-analysis called: [ttl]. Each abstract should be assessed objectively, based on its research focus and its potential contribution to a balanced and meaningful synthesis of contents. Your expertise in evaluating academic rigor, combined with your understanding of sensitivity and specificity, should guide you in making decisions that align with the highest standards of scholarly practice.    By balancing sensitivity and specificity, and focusing on the research questions, hypotheses, and topics, you will ensure that your screening process contributes to a meta-analysis called: [ttl] that accurately reflects the available evidence while maintaining the integrity and reliability expected of such an effort.

Consider whether the abstract suggests a work that addresses meaningful research outcomes, and demonstrates coherence in its discovery. Your decisions should be guided by an objective and balanced approach, ensuring that the selection process captures studies with significant and relevant results while avoiding irrelevant or tangential works.Be deliberate in your assessment. Include abstracts only when you are confident their research discovery aligns with the general objectives of [ttl] and can meaningfully contribute to its synthesis. Exclude abstracts only when you are certain their conclusions lack the depth, scope, or relevance required to meet the broad criteria for inclusion. This process demands precision, as each decision will directly impact the integrity and comprehensiveness of the meta-analysis.Your expertise and judgment are central to this task. As you screen the abstracts, focus on identifying those that reflect relevant insight into the current state of relevant findings, research outcomes, and results in the field. Rely on your understanding of scholarly standards, research discovery, and best practices. Your careful and thoughtful approach will ensure that [ttl] achieves its goal of creating a meaningful and high-quality representation of the available results of the field.By findingsing this task with meticulous attention to detail, fairness, and consistency, you will help lay the foundation for a robust meta-analysis. Your selections, based on the research outcomes, findings, and results of the papers, will reflect the principles of rigorous academic evaluation, ensuring that the meta-analysis abstractd [ttl] provides a reliable and comprehensive synthesis of the research landscape.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
