    "# Generating Diverse Prompts for Section References and Meta-Analysis Info Combinations\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This file aims to create a set of diverse and varied prompts for each combination of *Section Reference* and *Meta-Analysis Info* categories. The primary goal is to extend and enrich the initial set of prompts by varying their language structure by alternating the syntax and choice of words by alternating semantics, ensuring the outputs are sufficiently different while maintaining their original intent.\n",
    "\n",
    "By doing so, we aim to generate up to as many prompts to receive 20 unique prompts per combination, suitable for further use in classification, training, or testing scenarios. This variation enhances the linguistic richness and diversity of the dataset, ensuring broader applicability and adaptability. Afterwards, we are going to extend them by 10 prompts received by a large language model.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "To achieve the goal, the following approach is taken:\n",
    "1.\tInput Dataset:\n",
    "- The dataset contains prompts categorized by *Section Reference* (e.g., “No Reference,” “Topic,” “Methods,” “Results”) and *Meta-Analysis Info* (e.g., “No Info,” “For MA,” “Title,” “Criteria”).\n",
    "- Each prompt is associated with a specific combination of these two dimensions.\n",
    "2.\tPrompt Expansion Using Markov Chains:\n",
    "- The markovify package is used to simulate new prompts by leveraging Markov chains.\n",
    "- All prompts belonging to a specific combination of categories are used as input to a Markov model, which generates new prompts based on observed patterns in the input data.\n",
    "- This allows for the creation of prompts that retain the style and structure of the originals while introducing variation.\n",
    "3.\tEnsuring Uniqueness and Quality:\n",
    "- The generated prompts are checked against the existing prompts to ensure no duplicates are added.\n",
    "- Prompts are also filtered for redundancy within the same generation cycle.\n",
    "- If a generated prompt doesn’t meet the criteria (e.g., it is too similar to the originals or doesn’t make sense), the model generates additional prompts to compensate.\n",
    "4.\tFinal Validation of Markov Chain Model:\n",
    "- Prompts are formatted uniformly to maintain a consistent presentation.\n",
    "- Outputs are reviewed, and necessary adjustments are made to improve clarity, variation, and alignment with the intended meaning. If needed, the cycle is run again go receive the missing prompts\n",
    "5. Extension of Prompts by LLM\n",
    "- Utilizing a pre-trained LLM to generate 10 additional prompts for each combination of *Section Reference* and *Meta-Analysis Info*.\n",
    "- Ensure that these new prompts align with the existing structure and intent of the original prompts.\n",
    "6. Final Dataset\n",
    "- Combine all prompts into a final dataset, ensuring each combination of categories has a comprehensive set of prompts.\n",
    "- This final dataset will be used for further classification, training, or testing scenarios, providing a robust and diverse set of prompts for various applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why This Approach?\n",
    "\n",
    "Using Markov chains enables the generation of syntactically coherent variations based on existing data. This method ensures:\n",
    "- Efficiency: Quickly generates multiple variations without requiring manual input for each prompt.\n",
    "- Diversity: Captures different sentence structures and word choices while retaining the essence of the original prompts.\n",
    "- Scalability: Handles multiple combinations of categories, making it suitable for large datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Enhancing Markov Chain Models with LLMs\n",
    "\n",
    "While Markov chains are effective in generating syntactically coherent variations based on existing data, they have limitations in capturing the deeper semantic relationships and contextual nuances present in natural language. Markov chains rely on the probability of word sequences, which can lead to repetitive and sometimes nonsensical outputs, especially when the input data is limited or lacks diversity. To address these limitations, we incorporate Large Language Models (LLMs) into our prompt generation process. LLMs, such as GPT-3, are pre-trained on vast amounts of text data and are capable of understanding and generating human-like text with a high degree of coherence and relevance. By leveraging LLMs, we can:\n",
    "- Enhance Diversity: LLMs can generate a wider range of prompts with varied sentence structures and vocabulary, reducing the risk of repetitive outputs that are common with Markov chains.\n",
    "- Improve Contextual Understanding: LLMs have a better grasp of context and can produce prompts that are more aligned with the intended meaning and purpose, ensuring higher quality and relevance.\n",
    "- Increase Semantic Richness: By incorporating LLMs, we can generate prompts that capture deeper semantic relationships, making the outputs more meaningful and useful for downstream tasks.\n",
    "- Maintain Coherence: LLMs can generate longer and more complex prompts while maintaining coherence, which is challenging for Markov chains that operate on fixed state sizes.\n",
    "\n",
    "By combining the strengths of Markov chains and LLMs, we achieve a robust and diverse set of prompts that are both syntactically and semantically rich, enhancing the overall quality and applicability of the generated dataset. By the end of this process, we will have a rich, diverse, and meaningful set of prompts that are ready for deployment in various applications."
