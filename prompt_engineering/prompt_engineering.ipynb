    "# Generating Diverse Prompts for Section References and Meta-Analysis Info Combinations\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This file aims to create a set of diverse and varied prompts for each combination of *Section Reference* and *Meta-Analysis Info* categories. The primary goal is to extend and enrich the initial set of prompts by varying their language structure by alternating the syntax and choice of words by alternating semantics, ensuring the outputs are sufficiently different while maintaining their original intent.\n",
    "\n",
    "By doing so, we aim to generate up to as many prompts to receive 50 unique prompts per combination, suitable for further use in classification, training, or testing scenarios. This variation enhances the linguistic richness and diversity of the dataset, ensuring broader applicability and adaptability.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "To achieve the goal, the following approach is taken:\n",
    "1.\tInput Dataset:\n",
    "- The dataset contains prompts categorized by *Section Reference* (e.g., “No Reference,” “Topic,” “Methods,” “Results”) and *Meta-Analysis Info* (e.g., “No Info,” “For MA,” “Title,” “Criteria”).\n",
    "- Each prompt is associated with a specific combination of these two dimensions.\n",
    "2.\tPrompt Expansion Using Markov Chains:\n",
    "- The markovify package is used to simulate new prompts by leveraging Markov chains.\n",
    "- All prompts belonging to a specific combination of categories are used as input to a Markov model, which generates new prompts based on observed patterns in the input data.\n",
    "- This allows for the creation of prompts that retain the style and structure of the originals while introducing variation.\n",
    "3.\tEnsuring Uniqueness and Quality:\n",
    "- The generated prompts are checked against the existing prompts to ensure no duplicates are added.\n",
    "- Prompts are also filtered for redundancy within the same generation cycle.\n",
    "- If a generated prompt doesn’t meet the criteria (e.g., it is too similar to the originals or doesn’t make sense), the model generates additional prompts to compensate.\n",
    "4.\tFinal Validation:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Prompts are formatted uniformly to maintain a consistent presentation.\n",
    "- Outputs are reviewed, and necessary adjustments are made to improve clarity, variation, and alignment with the intended meaning. If needed, the cycle is run again go receive the missing prompts\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why This Approach?\n",
    "\n",
    "Using Markov chains enables the generation of syntactically coherent variations based on existing data. This method ensures:\n",
    "- Efficiency: Quickly generates multiple variations without requiring manual input for each prompt.\n",
    "- Diversity: Captures different sentence structures and word choices while retaining the essence of the original prompts.\n",
    "- Scalability: Handles multiple combinations of categories, making it suitable for large datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this process, we will have a rich, diverse, and meaningful set of prompts that are ready for deployment in various applications."
